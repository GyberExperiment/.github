## OpenDevCommmune

Welcome to the Gybernaty community! We are an open community of developers and enthusiasts exploring and developing technologies that are relevant to society. Our philosophy is that technology should be accessible to everyone, not just a limited group of individuals or closed corporations, so we use open source code and provide everyone the opportunity to participate in the development of our open products.

We are looking for new members who share our philosophy and are willing to join our open source projects. We have three main research areas: blockchain, distributed computing, and neural networks.

We are creating a social network that belongs to all members of the community and will be managed through blockchain and smart contract DAOs.

We are also starting the development of open artificial intelligence models that will be managed by the community through DAO contracts and blockchain.

We use the most current technologies and integrate them into our projects.

We have many benefits for different categories of specialists, regardless of their level of knowledge and experience.

For beginner developers, we provide educational programs and internships that help them expand their knowledge and gain experience working with new technologies. We give beginner developers the opportunity to become part of the community and work with advanced specialists, learning from them and gaining experience in real projects.

For experienced developers, we offer the opportunity to work in a professional team on projects that solve current societal problems and apply the most current and innovative technologies.

For designers, we offer the opportunity to work on projects that will have a significant impact on society. Our team of designers is working on creating innovative UX/UI that will be convenient for all users.

For managers and coordinators, we offer the opportunity to work with the team and make decisions that will be beneficial to society and help develop our open projects.

Our Gybernaty community is a place where everyone can learn the art of development, learn about the latest technologies, and contribute to open source projects.

As part of the internship, each participant receives community crypto-tokens that can be used in the future as currency within the community, for example, to pay for goods and services, or to access exclusive materials, events, and resources.

We are looking for talented and motivated people willing to participate in research and development of projects based on open technologies and software.
